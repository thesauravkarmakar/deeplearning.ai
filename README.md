## :page_with_curl: About 
This repository contains notes,solutions to all the programming assignments. Doing this specialization is probably more than the first step into Deep Learning. I would say, each course is a single step in the right direction, so you end up with five steps in total. Nonetheless, Iâ€™m quite aware that this is definitely not enough to pursue a further career in Deep Learning. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
