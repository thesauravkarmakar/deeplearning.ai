## Course summary

Here is the course summary as its given on the course [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network):

> This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow. 
>
> After 3 weeks, you will: 
> - Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
> - Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking, 
> - Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
> - Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
> - Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow. 
>
> This is the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization.
